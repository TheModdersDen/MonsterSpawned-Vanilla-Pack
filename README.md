## About

This is the modpack for my private Minecraft server. It is built from scratch using various mods and is currently running on Minecraft 1.20.1.

The modpack is built using the [PrismMC Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) to test, run it, and export it. The modpack is hosted on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/ms-server-pack) and is open for all to use, respective to the terms of the authors of the mods in this pack.

## Modlist

The modpack is built using a variety of mods, and will be updated soon, as it has been revamped and is being re-indexed...
